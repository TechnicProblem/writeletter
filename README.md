# writeletter
The most useless library ever created.

## What is this
It prints a single letter of your choice. One at a time.

## How to use
`writeLetter.writeLetter('A');`
Replace the A with a single letter. Or number. Or something else. But just one.

### Hello World
    import writeCharacter.writeLetter;
    
    public class Main {
    	
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
		writeLetter.writeLetter('H');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('E');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('L');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('L');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('O');
		writeLetter.writeLetter(' ');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('W');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('O');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('R');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('L');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('D');
		writeLetter.writeLetter('!');
    	}
    }

### This is stupid!
Yes it is. I apparently have nothing better to do with my time.
